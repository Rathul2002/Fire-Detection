# Fire Detection using YOLOv8 on Custom Dataset
This repository contains code and resources for detecting fires in videos and images using YOLOv8 object detection algorithm trained on a custom dataset.

Introduction
Fire detection is a critical task in various applications including surveillance, firefighting, and safety systems. This project aims to leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to accurately detect fires in images. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is known for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it suitable for applications where timely detection is crucial.

Dataset
The custom dataset used for training the model consists of annotated images containing various instances of fires. Additionally, it includes images with diverse backgrounds, lighting conditions, and fire sizes to ensure robustness of the trained model.
